### Description

ASTEROIDS!!!, pretty big project, full game. Well i finally fixed the annoying bugs and added a few new features. I also shaved the graphics files out of the zip file since they are contained in the frx. I also have the compiled version available at my website in a distributable format, i.e. setup proggy. anyway, enjoy.
